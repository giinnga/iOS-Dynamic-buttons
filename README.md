# iOS-Dynamic-buttons

This framework is in early development stage.

This is my very first iOS Framework, so sorry if anything is unusual.

Pull requests and sugenstions are highly apreciated.


I have started this project with the idea os Space. The way the space is used in devices can change its approval by the users, so I decided to try something diferent. One button and many possibilities.
